# Sage - AI-Powered Learning Assistant

## Overview
Sage is a Generative AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students with personalized tutoring. It leverages advanced AI models to provide multimodal (text, voice, and image) input support, interactive learning paths, and adaptive feedback loops to enhance the learning experience.

## Features
- **Multimodal Input Support:** Users can input text, voice, or images to interact with the AI tutor.
- **Adaptive Learning Paths:** Dynamically adjusts learning content based on user progress.
- **Guided Study Mode:** Provides structured lessons and ensures users stay on topic.
- **Self-Study Mode:** Allows users to explore topics, read AI-generated notes, and ask follow-up questions.
- **Evaluation & Feedback:** Includes quizzes and AI-powered feedback to reinforce learning.
- **Content Moderation:** Ensures safe and appropriate interactions using OpenAI's Moderation API.
- **Scalability & Security:** Built with Docker and API-based architecture for easy deployment and management.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI, Flask)
- **AI Models:** OpenAI GPT-4, Amazon Bedrock
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, Pinecone (Vector Database)
- **Cloud Services:** AWS Lambda, S3, API Gateway
- **Frontend:** React Native (for mobile application)
- **Deployment:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (Optional)
